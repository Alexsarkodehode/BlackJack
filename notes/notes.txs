To make a blackjack app i need different things. 
The players that are playing the card game
The cards themselves(A, K, Q etc.)
the card dealer that is sharing the cards out to the players that are sitting around the table
A score tracker that is tracking the score, who is leading and who is loosing, things like that. 
A result board that is showing the result. 

Making my own loop.
there are 52 cards in a card stack.
